# TrackTime
TrackTime is a Garmin app designed to help runners optimize their training by providing precise split timing on a track.

### Features
Customizable Split Distance: Choose ForeRunner om distances such as 100m, 200m, 400m.
Target Pace Input: Set your desired pace (e.g., 4:00 per kilometer), and the app will calculate split times automatically.
Buzz Notifications: Get notified with a buzz once you are supposed to be arriving at each split to stay on track. If it buzzes before you are there, better pick up the pace. If it buzzes after, maybe you are going too fast.
Lap Timer: View a running lap timer on your watch display for real-time progress.
Workout Integration: Automatically buzz only during the run segments of your structured Garmin workouts.

### Getting Started
Download and install the TrackTime app for ForeRunner ee ForeRunner om the Garmin Connect IQ Store (coming soon).
Ensure that your Garmin device is compatible with the app.


### Usage
On the run settings, you must add the Data Field to a Data Screen. The pace and split distances can be customized on the Connect IQ phone app.

Buzz at the calculated target times for your chosen split distances.
