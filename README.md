# TrackTime
TrackTime is a Garmin app designed to help runners optimize their training by providing precise split timing on a track.

### Features
Customizable Split Distance: Choose from distances such as 100m, 200m, 400m.
Target Pace Input: Set your desired pace (e.g., 4:00 per kilometer), and the app will calculate split times automatically.
Buzz Notifications: Get notified with a buzz once you are supposed to be arriving at each split to stay on track. If it buzzes before you are there, better pick up the pace. If it buzzes after, maybe you are going too fast.
Lap Timer: View a running lap timer on your watch display for real-time progress.
Workout Integration: Automatically buzz only during the run segments of your structured Garmin workouts.

### Getting Started
Download and install the TrackTime app for free from the Garmin Connect IQ Store (coming soon). Or just download the TrackTime.prg and transfer manually to the Apps folder in the watch.
Ensure that your Garmin device is compatible with the app.


### Usage
On the run settings, you must add the Data Field to a Data Screen. The pace and split distances can be customized on the Connect IQ phone app.
TrackTime will:
Buzz at the calculated target times for your chosen split distances.
Display a lap timer on the screen to show your real-time split progress.
If you're performing a workout, the app will automatically restrict buzzing to the run segments only.

### Compatibility
